A 4-bit code converter for even parity converts the 4-bit input to 5-bit output so that even parity is ensured
Parity bit comes in hand to check whether a unit of binary data has any error during the
transmission of binary data. The message containing the binary data with the parity bit gets
transmitted from the transmitter node to the receiver node.
Even parity refers to a parity checking mode in asynchronous communication systems that
indicates whether a unit of binary data is an even number or odd. The parity bit is set to 1 if the
number of 1s in the binary number is an odd number. The parity bit is set to 0 if the number of
1s in the binary number is an even number.
There are two types of parity bits, even and odd.
If the original data is 1010, the parity bit will be 0 so that the number of 1â€™s in the data remains
even.
Parity bit sequence matters significantly since any wrong bit can lead to a misinterpreted output.
